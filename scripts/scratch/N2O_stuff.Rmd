The CEDS N2O and CH4 emissions end earlier than we would like them to, in this document we 
back calculate what the Hector emissions should be in order to reproduce the Global 
GHG concentration data for the CMIP6 historical runs or our observations in this case. 


```{r}
# Here we will want to do the set up for the script, where we read in the obs from meinahours 
# will need to do some interpolation and extraploxation booooo, but then we we can convert teh obs to emission ts and 
# compare that with the rcmip historcal emissiosn, ceds emissiosn and these new ones I think then we 
# send those to rachel and steve and see what they think about doing some sort of smoothing to get the other ermissions to match up
# up with the ceds inputs BLEH i think that this coudl acltually take a while....
